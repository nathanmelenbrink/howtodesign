		<h2> About: </h2>
		<p> How to Design (almost) Anything introduces fundamental design principles and practices, such as seeing, sketching, storytelling, prototyping and performing, as a way to demystify design as a discipline. Taught by a diverse group of faculty, students dive deeply into design through lectures, labs, and weekly project assignments. Technique-based class intended for students without a design background enables more effective collaboration with designers and the ability to apply the foundations of design to any discipline. </p>

		<p> How to Design (almost) Anything is a spin-off from Neil Gershenfeld's course How to Make (almost) Anything, taught at the Center for Bits and Atoms. For many years, a topic of discussion was the possibility of embedding more design instruction into the course. In the Fall of 2015, Justin Lavallee and Nathan Melenbrink initiated weekly design critiques and delivered a recitation with the title "How to Design (almost) Anything" as an experimental approach to addressing this. We realized through trial and error that trying to shoehorn Design into HTMaA was unlikely to be an ideal format. At a final Design recitation in the Fall of 2015, Neil joined us for a lively discussion as to the possibilities of a course called "How to Design (almost) Anything", after which Justin and Nathan would be joined by Jonathan Grinham and Skylar Tibbits to pursue the development of this course.  </p>

		<p> The course was developed over 2016 in order to be offered for the first time in the Spring of 2017. The format of the course draws on the successes of How To Make. ........  </p>
